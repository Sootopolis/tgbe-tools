## I. Background

### 1. The Club

We are a chess club on chess.com that actively participate in daily chess club matches and currently sits 10th on the daily club match worldwide leaderboard.

### 2. Game and Match Formats

In a daily chess game, a player must make a move in a given number of days (usually 3, but can also be 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14), whereas failure to do so will result in a loss by timeout. 

In a club match between two clubs:

* Before a match starts, each club field a list of players sorted by ratings from high to low.
* When a match starts, the two lists of players are zipped up, with each pair of players (known as a board) playing two games with each other (one as white and the other as black). The number of boards will be the length of the shorter list of players.
* When a game finishes, if the result is decisive (i.e. if a player beat the other), 1 point is awarded to the winner's club, else 1/2 points is awarded to both clubs.
* When all games in a match finish, the match finishes. `5 * (number of boards)` leaderboard points is awarded to the club with more points; in case that the clubs tie in points, `2 * (number of boards)` leadership points is awarded to both.

### 3. My Role as Club Admin

As an admin of my club, I am mainly in charge of inviting players from other clubs to join my club ("looting"/"raiding", as we call it - but as a player can belong to a virtually unlimited number of clubs, I am not actually stealing players away from other clubs). 

To invite a player, an admin must send the player an invitation through an official invitation portal, else risk getting banned from the site for spamming. Up to 30 invitations are available at any given time on the portal, and once an invitation is sent, it will be replenished after exactly 24 hours. An invited player can decide to join the club or not.

I aim to invite players who: 

* are online recently

  (to easily filter out inactive players)

* are not in too many clubs

  (they tend not to do much for any of them)

* play club matches for their current clubs

  (if they don't play for their clubs, they're unlikely to play for us)

* do not time out club matches

  (if they time out club matches for other clubs, they're likely to do it for us too; note that I don't care if they time out personal games such as individual tournaments)

* do not move too slow

  (it's annoying)

* do not have too many daily games ongoing 

  (it incurs a huge risk of a massive timeout)

* do not have suspiciously high win rate and elo rating 

  (they can be banned for cheating)

* do not have pathetically low win rate and elo rating 

  (they are not of much use to the club)
